if characters are not long enough with the words, append random letters from the alphabet 
if too long, remove the excess chars
1 = 1 word, min 8 characters, 1 uppercase, rest lowercase, 1 int, 1 special char
2 = 1 word, min 12 characters, 2 uppercase, rest lower, 2 int, 2 special char
3 = 2 words, min 14 char, 2 uppercase per word, rest lower, 3 int, 3 special char 
4 = 2 words, min 18 char, 3 uppercase per word, rest lower, 4 int, 4 special char

if "randomly assembled" is chosen, all of these elements get randomly
strung together instead of a simple append
